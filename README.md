## Description

This project started as a personal side project, I get the idea from the
Saved Messages telegram feature, whose interface is actually a chat. I
used to use that chat to save some of my links but I wanted a way to group
them by category. That's why I decided to build my own bookmark keeper
app. For that, I used the MERN stack, but divided the project in [API](https://github.com/PerezEnrique/bookmarks-keeper-api) and
client.
